# How To Use
For every script there is a different use and ways to fully take advantage on other modders. 

For Kiddions script is just puting the script into scripts directory, inside the Kiddions files.

For Stand it is actually the same way, but first before initiating the script you will need to go into library and search for the natives-1676318796 and then you will be able to use the script and his various functions.

## GtaVScripts 
Im presenting you some Gta V Scripts for online or campaign, these are made by me so if you find an error please dm to discord. (Pichocles#0427)

1- A really nice lua, complement for kiddions modding engine for Gta V, im not aware of use you can do to this shitty lua script.

2- A nice lua for Stand!, a paid modding engine that has more features and a super nice lua api, so no problems in this one, coming soon boys with a lot of online features and player op lua crashes.

## Questions Ryze-Kiddions-GtaV: 
- The kiddions lua is for the modding engine yall maybe know for Gta-V called "Kiddions", it is made for everyone who doesn't like to be annoyed by any type of modder, and if you want to make youre account op. This has recovery features, protection features and some Online features also.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Questions Ryze-Stand-GtaV 
- This is a lua also for the paid modding engine called stand, it is a complement of various scripts also known, im just improving the code and adding some extra features that the menu doesn't have like more protections to make unable to the modders to grief you, lag you etc.
Im also thinking on some extra features, like more protections and trolling options and much more than i have in today's version.

## Questions RyzeM-redENGINE
- This is a lua also for the paid modding engine called redENGINE, it is a menu re-build from the past one called Fallout, I was a couple of years working on this project has a main idea but sadly i got beamed from FiveM, right now i have the vision to continue it because it is a pretty well made menu, so enjoy it and make fun in some servers.
- By the way you need redENGINE obviously.

- Meaning Emojis:
✅ Undetected
🚧 Working on
🔻 Detected
- Status of the Menu:
 * FiveM Undetected: Check redENGINE Status 
 * ChocoHax Status: ✅
 * GodZilla Status: ✅
 * FiveGuard Status: 🚧
 * FiveEye Status: 🚧

I'm aware and im working on anticheat detections, just becarefull with "SafeMode" this should make the Menu undetected for majority of servers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No ETA for big updates also because i don't know actually if im going to be able to continue this script (boths) because i have a life and i need to study. This is a helpfull and fun project for everyone who wants to use it, is free and you can use my script has a template.

-  By the way to anyone who ask's about the stand script, is not entire mine, there is actually in credits every single person who i taked code from and who helped me with this.
